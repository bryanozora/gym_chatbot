## 📌 Features

- **Personalized Recommendations**: Suggests workouts based on user goals and preferences.
- **Natural Language Understanding**: Communicates naturally with users for intuitive interaction.
- **Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG)**: Combines search and generative models to provide relevant answers.
- **Session Memory**: Maintains chat history for continuity in conversations.
- **Image Embedding**: Uses Fitz/PyMuPDF for embedding image into conversations

## 🛠️ Technologies Used

- **Language**: Python  
- **Framework**: Streamlit, OpenAI Swarm  
- **Libraries**:
  - `nltk` – for text preprocessing and tokenization  
  - `fastembed` – for efficient embedding generation  
  - `qdrant-client` – to interface with the Qdrant vector database  
  - `fitz` / `PyMuPDF` – for parsing and extracting text from PDFs  
  - `pandas` – for data manipulation and job dataset handling  
  - `scikit-learn` – for job category classification  
  - `spacy` – for skill extraction from resumes  
  - `llama-index` – for building and querying vector-based document indices  
  - `openai` – for language modeling and RAG-style completions  
- **Other Tools**:  
  - Vector Embedding (FastEmbed + Qdrant via LlamaIndex)  
  - Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) pipeline using LlamaIndex + OpenAI  
  - Resume parsing and semantic matching  
  - CSV-based job and application storage
